### Resume about the project
I always wanted to know how time i spend coding, so i decided to start this project for fun. And was hard, because im a little dumb and every time i wrote something that broke the codeðŸ˜’
### How to Run
Do a simply repository clone and certify to install the dependencies, **if your Python was equal or superior of `Python 3.12.1` the most of the requisits was installed and you have just to install "psutil" doing a simple `pip install psutil`**
- **All Dependencies:** `Psutil` , `Time` , `Json` , `Datetime`.

### How to Use
Its simple. In your VsCode, go on ``"..."`` -> ``"Terminal"`` -> ``"Configure Default Build Task..."``</br>  And certify that you are in the **USER**  **"Task.json"**. After this, just copy and past the code in the <a href = "https://github.com/Isaac4lves/TempoCodando/blob/main/SampleCode.txt" > "SampleCode.txt" <a> CERTIFY that the variable of the **main  line 6** is correct !
 </br>
After configure the USER **Task.json** and the **variable** you just need to go in the Search and click in **Run Task** to start the counter.

</br>

## Finished Features
- Stores the seconds with **VsCode** open and documents everything in a **.JSON** file. ALSO record the day of the week you are on.

## Unfinished Features
- At the end of the week calculate the average.
